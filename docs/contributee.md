For the **repository owner**, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute.


For **contributors**, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.


For both **owners and contributors**, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.
